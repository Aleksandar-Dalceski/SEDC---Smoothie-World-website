        "description": "Native to Southeast Asia, butterfly pea flower tea has a similar taste and health benefits to green tea, but no caffeine. It’s also been called “mood ring tea” for its cool color-changing abilities! The rest of the ingredients in this smoothie, honeydew, pear, lemon and yellow squash, are hydrating and fiber-filled, and the addition of almonds add a bit of healthy fat and protein. Pro Tip: For the full “mood ring” effect, brew the butterfly pea flower tea in ¼ cup of hot water for 2-3 minutes. This will turn the tea bright blue. If you add the lemon to the tea prior to blending, the liquid will turn purple. Isn’t nature cool?"
