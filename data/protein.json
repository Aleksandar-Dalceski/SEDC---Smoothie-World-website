        "description": "Whether you’re new to the smoothie game, or just have a pretty big sweet tooth, dates are one of the best ways to sweeten up any blend! Not only do they provide both soluble and insoluble fiber, they’re also high in calcium, phosphorus and antioxidants. When combined with pear (another sweet, fiber-filled fruit), mild summer squash, and acai berry powder (which packs a big antioxidant punch), they create a sweet treat that will keep you satisfied and energized for hours."

          "description": "The popularity of kiwifruit in America began during WWII, when servicemen stationed in New Zealand first got a taste. While everyone thinks of oranges as being packed with vitamin C, just one cup of raw kiwi provides around 270 percent of your daily recommended amount, making it the perfect fruit for brightening your complexion from the inside out. Nectarines contain beta-carotene, another complexion-loving vitamin, and spinach is full of iron and vitamin K, essential nutrients for healthy bones and blood. Give your immune system a boost with this green dream."

Because almonds pack a nutritious punch of protein, healthy fats, and fiber, they’re really one of the best blending additions out there – and the best part? They create a perfectly creamy smoothie."
