        "recipe": "[ 1 plum - pitted ] - [ 2 oranges - peeled ] - [ 2 tomatillos - husked ] - [ 1/2 inch ginger ] - [ 1 tbsp quinoa flakes ] - [ 1 cup water ] - [ 1 cup ice ]",
        "description": "Also known as Mexican husk tomatoes, tomatillos are a staple of Mexican cuisine. (If you’ve ever had salsa verde, you’ve had a tomatillo!) Low in calories but relatively high in fiber, tomatillos are a great way to add volume to smoothies while still keeping things light. Additionally, tomatillos include niacin, a naturally occurring B vitamin that helps cells turn food into energy — an important aspect of metabolism. At only 103 calories per serving, this low cal breakfast has enough vitamins to keep you going all day long!"

        "recipe": "[ 5 oz summer squash - chopped ] - [ 1 orange - peeled ] - [ 2 oz blueberries ] - [ 1 tsp acai berry powder ] - [ 1 tbsp flaxseed ] - [ 1 cup water ] - [ 1 cup ice ]",
        "description": "A small brown or golden seed that comes from a crop grown in cooler climates, flax, also known as linseed, is both a food and textile crop. One of the biggest benefits to eating flax is the amount of lignans available per serving. Lignans are antioxidants that can actually help balance hormones, and may help fight against hormone-related cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. Add some more antioxidants from acai berry powder and blueberries, and you have a low calorie, immune-boosting powerhouse breakfast."

        "description": "Like lemons, kiwis are antibacterial and antifungal, which is why many people use them in homemade face mask recipes. Kiwis also provide more lutein per serving than almost any other commonly-eaten fruit. Lutein is a phytochemical that not only protects skin, but is extremely beneficial for eye health. Bok choy, a nectarine, and hemp seeds are also fantastic for your skin, which means this smoothie loves your immune system and your complexion!"
