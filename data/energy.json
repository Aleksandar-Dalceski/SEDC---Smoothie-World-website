When you combine yellow beets with ginger root and flaxseed, two potent anti-inflammatories, you get a fantastic smoothie for your muscles, immune system, and even your complexion!"

          "description":"Rhubarb is a classic spring food that signifies warmer days and barbecuing out on the lawn. While most people consider rhubarb to be a fruit (it was even “declared” a fruit in 1947 in a New York court), it’s actually classified as a vegetable, and only the stems of the plant can be eaten. With plenty of healthy fats and protein, cashews are a great way to make your smoothie thick and creamy, without adding dairy or a banana."
